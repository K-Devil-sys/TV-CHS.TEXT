MOB_20B=Somebody has taken offense to you acting like the big guy all of a sudden, giving it the big shot thing.
MOB_20C=Well, don't say I never warned you or nothing. Boasting is a mug's game, son.

MOB_33A=Tommy, it's Phil, now cut out all the reminiscing crap and listen to me, you hear?
MOB_33B=Good. I got me some extra strength boomshine nearing fermentation time and I was wondering if you'd fancy having a shot.
MOB_33C=Seriously, Tommy, if you like a drink, or if you need to strip paint, this stuff'll make a man out of you.
MOB_33D=Sure did out of me, even though I can't see out of one eye. I'll be waiting for you, y'hear.
MOB_34A=Tommy, I really enjoyed working with you. Ain't had so much fun since the ridge in Nam, pal.
MOB_34B=Anyhows, you need anything, you call on me, you hear?
MOB_34C=I always remember those I served with,
MOB_34D=and I am sure I can help you out, you hear?
MOB_35A=Tommy, the wound is healing well. Funny thing is,
MOB_35B=I have fought in 6 battle zones and always walked away without a scratch, and now this!
MOB_35C=One armed Phil. Still, I got me a healthy selection of one handed fire power so I'll never be unarmed Phil, you hear.
MOB_35D=Any way son, cut out the sentimental crap and go buy yourself a drink, you hear!
MOB_36A=Tommy, it's Phil, I want to thank you for helping me out back there son,
MOB_36B=Damn Charlie, he'll always ambush you somewhere or other,

MOB_41D=You never write me, you never call. Don't you want to be friends no more?
MOB_41E=I've been busy trying to sort things out. You didn't give me a lot of support down here, Sonny.
MOB_41F=Oh, my fault is it? We'll I've heard you been busy all right.
MOB_41G=Busy killing drugs barons. Busy taking over.
MOB_41H=Don't forget about us, Tommy, 'cause I can assure you, I ain't forgotten about you.
MOB_42A=Tommy.
MOB_42B=Sonny.
MOB_42C=Obviously you are suffering from hearing problems, so I'll try again.
MOB_42D=Where's the goddamned money, where's the goddamned stuff, and where's my cut of your new action?
MOB_42E=You are making an idiot out of me, Tommy, and I'm not laughing yet.
MOB_43A=Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, I had Sonny on the phone, ok, are you with me?.
MOB_43B=I don't know about you, but there's something about a man threatening to murder my family
MOB_43C=which really scares the crap out of me. What are you going to do?
MOB_43D=Ken, take it easy.
MOB_43E=I AM calm, calm as a man can be when he's fearing for his life!
MOB_43F=Stay off the idiot fuel and look after yourself.
MOB_43G=No one's gonna take us out. I'll see you later.

MOB_63C=I'm doing okay. I'll need a stick to walk, but I should be back at work soon enough.
MOB_63D=Good.
MOB_63E=I heard about Lance. What a little prick, eh?
MOB_63F=Yes.
MOB_63G=Never trust a man who walks the streets in his pajamas. That's what I say. Glad you killed him. I hope it was painful for the prick.
MOB_63H=I think it was. I just didn't think he was like that...
MOB_63I=Tommy, for a raging lunatic, you're pretty naive. I'll be back at work soon, teach you a thing or two about life, you hear.
MOB_63J=Take your time, Earnest. Look after yourself.
MOB_66A=Tommy, Tommy why you coming back here for?
